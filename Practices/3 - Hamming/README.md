# Hamming

Hamming Network can classify correctly come vectors, just having the restriction that they must be binary (1 or -1), the bias in feedforward layer can be calculated by the number of neurons (S) and giving to each element the value of the dimension of the weight matrix (R).

- User writes the name of the file that has weight matrix
- User writes the name of the file that has entry vector
- The NNA start iterating until last 2 outputs are equal and just one element is nonzero
- The program shows in which iteration converges and a graph of the evolution of the outputs by neuron
