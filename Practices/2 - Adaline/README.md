This ANN has a target, so, is supervised learning.

The learning process of this ANN is a little complicated, thats why I will explain generally in what consists, first, we have to ask for 3 parameters to the user.
- Alpha: Learning factor
- Maximum iterations: For the stop condition
- Wished Error: A little value that the user wants to approximate de error signal of the network

In every iteration, we calculate the error signal by adding all the values of each individual error and then dividing by the number of data in the training set.
