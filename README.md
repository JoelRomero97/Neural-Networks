# Neural Networks

Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are becoming increasily useful in every branch that includes technology or statistics to analyze some social or non social phenomena. Some technology experts say that the next years (from now to 2050) Artificial Intelligence will change the entire world in areas like medicine, education, industry, etc. 

Thats why is important to start learning how do IA works, starting with Neural Networks and understand how to implement the simple and basic.

In this repository you can find the implementation of some ANN, to separate into different classes or recognize patterns using supervised and non-supervised learning, such as Adaline, Hopfield, Multilayer and Simple Perceptron, etc using MATLAB
